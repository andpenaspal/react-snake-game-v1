## Objectives

Second ever React Project. The main objective of this project was to create a "Snake Game" without following any tutorials, exploring more complex React patterns.

Also, it was an excuse to explore the "Observer" pattern and get some practice with it in React.

CSS and a nice look to the Snake was not at the top of the priority list..
